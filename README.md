# dot-python

Dotfiles for managing Python.


## Installation

To install pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv, and install the latest stable release of Python in
the proper way, run the following command. 

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdegges/dot-python/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

**NOTE**: This assumes you've got your shell environment set up to properly
have `pyenv` installed in `$PATH`, etc. If you don't, you should probably just
follow the official [pyenv installation instructions](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) yourself.
